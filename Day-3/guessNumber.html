<!--Day-3 | Question-2:
	 Write a program in JavaScript where the Program chooses a number between 1 and 20. You are
	 then prompted to enter a guess. If the players guess wrong then the prompt appears again until
	 the guess is correct. When the player has made a sucessful guess, the computer will give a
	 "Well Guessed!" message and the program will exit.
